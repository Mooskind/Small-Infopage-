          <p>
            For a long time, he was dominated by a panic fear of the dark. After
            his grandfather had walked around the house with him at night, he
            became nocturnal himself. He soon hated daytime activities. He
            preferred to study in the dark, walking through the streets of
            Providence by the light of lanterns. Lovecraft was a withdrawn,
            introverted person and fought his fears with the help of his
            literature

            1916, Lovecraft published his first short story, "The Alchemist", in
            the main UAPA journal. Soon afterwards, he wrote "The Tomb" and
            "Dagon". "The Tomb", by Lovecraft's own admission, was greatly
            influenced by the style and structure of Edgar Allan Poe's works.
